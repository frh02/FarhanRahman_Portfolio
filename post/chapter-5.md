title: "Project 2: Prediction of Stock Price"
---
This project deals with up to date stock value trend in the 500 stock companies depending upon the different sectors we select for our analysis.I have used a very interesting package calle `streamlit` to host the python file as a web app.

The web application deals with web-scraping where the data used for analysis is scraped from wikipedia and then the data has been grouped by the different sector we want to do the analysis on. Additional features like selecting the number of companies we want to show the interactive plots can be customized.
